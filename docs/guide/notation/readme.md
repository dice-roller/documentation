# What are notations?

Dice can be rolled through the use of "notations".
A notation is a simple string of characters that tells the parser which dice and modifiers to roll.

The format of the notation is based on the Wikipedia article [Dice Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice_notation),
so it's consistent and conforms to a standard of sorts, albeit a very loose one.

It's then been enhanced to bring in extra functionality, that is not otherwise possible with the basic notation.


## Types

The notation can be split into several types:

* [Dice](dice.md) - _The different types of dice that can be rolled (e.g. `d6`, `d20`, `d%`, `dF`)._
* [Modifiers](modifiers.md) - _The modifiers that can affect dice rolls (e.g. "exploding", "re-roll")._
* [Group rolls](group-rolls.md) <Badge text="New" vertical="middle"/> - _Perform actions and modifiers on collections of rolls_
* [Roll descriptions](roll-descriptions.md) <Badge text="New" vertical="middle"/> - _Describing or labeling a roll._
* [Maths](maths.md) - _Generic mathematical equations._
